The code is organized into folders based on topics:

basics/ → Core Java programs (syntax, variables, operators, loops, functions).

array/ → Array operations and related problems.

recursion/ → Recursion practice problems.

divideandconquer/ → Divide & Conquer algorithms.

sorting/ → Sorting techniques (Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick, etc.).

backtracking/ → Backtracking problems (N-Queens, Sudoku, Rat in a Maze, etc.).

Additional standalone Java files (e.g., avg.java, javaBasics.java) demonstrate specific concepts.
